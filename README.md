## What Votely Does

Votely bridges the gap between political awareness and local action. Instead of endless debates about national politics, we help users understand their core values and channel them into concrete civic engagement in their communities.

## Why This Platform Exists

![Value Propositions](design-assets/valueprops.png)

**The Problem:** Young people feel disconnected from politics, seeing it as distant, divisive, or irrelevant to their daily lives. Traditional civic engagement feels intimidating and abstract.

**Our Solution:** Votely makes politics personal and actionable. Our 2-minute quiz helps users understand their values, then connects them with specific local opportunities that match their beliefs and interests.

**Impact Goals:** Transform political apathy into civic participation by making local democracy accessible, engaging, and results-oriented for a new generation.
