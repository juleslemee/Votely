1	P01	Economic power always turns into political power, so inequality threatens democracy.	Wealthy people and corporations use their money to influence politics through campaign donations, lobbying, and media ownership. Critics argue this corrupts democracy, though defenders claim successful people deserve more influence and anyone can organize politically.	Economic	Wealth & Power	-1	core	1	ALL	econ		
2	P02	Housing should be treated as a basic right, not mainly as an investment.	Everyone needs somewhere to live, so housing should be guaranteed like healthcare or education. Advocates see this as basic human dignity, but skeptics argue treating housing as investment creates wealth and government housing often fails.	Economic	Housing & Property	-1	core	1	ALL	econ		
3	P03	Governments should step in when technology eliminates large numbers of jobs.	When automation destroys entire industries, government should retrain workers or provide income support. Proponents believe society owes displaced workers help. The opposing view holds that markets naturally create new jobs and intervention slows necessary evolution.	Economic	Automation & Jobs	-1	core	1	ALL	econ		
4	P04	The economy should move away from fossil fuels, even if this costs more in the short term.	Climate change requires switching to clean energy even if it temporarily hurts the economy. This position views the transition as essential for survival, despite concerns about job losses and costs from those believing innovation will solve climate issues naturally.	Economic	Climate Economics	-1	core	1	ALL	econ		
5	P05	The economy would be fairer if more companies were owned by their workers instead of outside shareholders.	Companies run by their employees through cooperatives or profit-sharing create fairer workplaces. Supporters claim this reduces exploitation and improves motivation, though critics argue outside investors provide needed capital and worker ownership reduces efficiency.	Economic	Worker Ownership	-1	core	1	ALL	econ	yes	
6	P06	Redistributing wealth through taxes and public programs makes the economy stronger.	Taxing the wealthy to fund programs for everyone creates more opportunity and consumer spending. Progressives see this as investing in society. Conservatives counter that it punishes success and government spends less efficiently than individuals.	Economic	Redistribution as Growth	-1	core	1	ALL	econ	yes	
7	P07	The worth of a product comes only from what people are willing to pay, not from its labor or social benefit.	Things are worth whatever someone will pay - nothing has inherent value beyond market price. Market advocates trust prices to reveal true value, yet critics note this ignores social benefits, environmental costs, and price manipulation.	Economic	Subjective Value	1	core	1	ALL	econ	yes	
8	P08	Economic progress depends mainly on entrepreneurs taking risks, not on government planning.	Risk-taking entrepreneurs create most economic progress through innovation and new businesses. Free-market supporters credit individual initiative for prosperity, though others emphasize government research, infrastructure, and education enable entrepreneurship.	Economic	Entrepreneurship	1	core	1	ALL	econ		
9	P09	Markets naturally organize themselves better than governments can design them.	Markets coordinate millions of decisions better than any planner could through prices and competition. Believers in spontaneous order champion this view. Skeptics point to market failures, monopolies, and crises showing markets need guidance.	Economic	Spontaneous Order	1	core	1	ALL	econ		
10	P10	When credit is too easy or governments give subsidies, it leads to wasteful investments that collapse.	Cheap loans and government support create bubbles where people invest in worthless projects. Critics blame intervention for economic crises, yet defenders argue markets create bubbles naturally and government support prevents worse collapses.	Economic	Malinvestment	1	core	1	ALL	econ		
11	P11	Opening markets to global trade benefits society more than protecting local industries.	Free trade lets countries specialize in what they do best, making everyone richer. Globalists see protectionism as costly favoritism. Nationalists worry about job losses, dependency on other nations, and loss of important industries.	Economic	Free Trade	1	core	1	ALL	econ		
12	P12	Itâ€™s better for governments to balance budgets than to borrow heavily for new programs.	Governments should spend only what they collect in taxes to avoid debt burdens. Fiscal conservatives think discipline prevents crisis. Progressives argue government borrowing for infrastructure and education pays for itself through growth.	Economic	Government Debt	1	core	1	ALL	econ		
13	P13	All citizens should be required to complete military or civil service for the good of the nation.	Everyone should serve their country through military or community service to build unity and responsibility. Advocates see civic duty creating social cohesion. Opponents view mandatory service as forced labor violating individual freedom.	Governance	Mandatory Service	1	core	1	ALL	gov		
14	P14	Complex national decisions should be made by appointed experts rather than the general public.	Technical decisions about economics, health, and environment need expertise average voters lack. Technocrats trust qualified specialists over populist sentiment. Democrats fear this undermines self-governance and note experts can be wrong or serve elite interests.	Governance	Rule by Experts	1	core	1	ALL	gov		
15	P15	In times of crisis, leaders should be able to bypass normal checks and balances.	Emergencies require quick action without bureaucratic delays or political gridlock. Pragmatists think flexibility saves lives. Civil libertarians warn that leaders use crises to grab permanent power and checks exist precisely for difficult times.	Governance	Emergency Powers	1	core	1	ALL	gov		
16	P16	The country runs better when power is concentrated in a strong central authority.	Strong central leadership coordinates better than divided government or federalism. Advocates value decisive action and clear direction, but opponents fear concentration of power leads to tyranny and local control better serves diverse needs.	Governance	Centralization of Power	1	core	1	ALL	gov		
17	P17	The government should be able to monitor private communications if it improves national security.	Stopping terrorism and crime requires monitoring communications and gathering intelligence. Security hawks prioritize safety over privacy. Privacy advocates argue surveillance creates police states and security agencies abuse powers against innocent citizens.	Governance	Surveillance	1	core	1	ALL	gov	yes	
18	P18	Police should be given broad authority to maintain law and order, even if it limits some freedoms.	Effective law enforcement needs flexibility to stop crime before it happens. Law-and-order advocates think safety requires strong policing. Civil rights defenders fear this enables abuse, discrimination, and that prevention doesn't justify violating rights.	Governance	Police Powers	1	core	1	ALL	gov	yes	
19	P19	No branch of government should be allowed to accumulate too much power.	Separation of powers and term limits prevent any person or group from becoming too powerful. Constitutional conservatives see this as essential for freedom. Efficiency advocates think divided government causes gridlock and voters can remove bad leaders.	Governance	Checks and Balances	-1	core	1	ALL	gov	yes	
20	P20	Even hateful or offensive speech should remain legal and free from government restriction.	Even racist, sexist, or hateful speech deserves legal protection from government censorship. Free speech absolutists argue offensive ideas deserve protection. Others maintain hate speech causes real harm and tolerance shouldn't protect intolerance.	Governance	Free Speech	-1	core	1	ALL	gov	yes	
21	P21	People should have the right to own weapons without heavy government regulation.	Gun ownership protects against crime and tyranny, so regulations should be minimal. Second Amendment defenders see this as fundamental freedom. Gun control advocates argue easy access increases violence and modern weapons exceed self-defense needs.	Governance	Right to Bear Arms	-1	core	1	ALL	gov		
22	P22	Major policies should be decided directly by citizens through referendums.	Voters should directly decide major issues rather than leaving them to politicians. Direct democracy supporters trust citizen wisdom over representatives. Critics worry about mob rule, minority rights, and that complex issues need deliberation.	Governance	Direct Democracy	-1	core	1	ALL	gov		
23	P23	It is better to let some guilty people go free than to risk punishing an innocent person.	Legal systems should require proof beyond doubt because wrongful conviction is worse than acquittal. This position prioritizes protecting innocence. Others argue it lets criminals escape justice and some certainty must be sacrificed for safety.	Governance	Due Process	-1	core	1	ALL	gov		
24	P24	The justice system should focus on rehabilitation rather than harsh punishment, even for serious crimes.	Criminals can be reformed through education and therapy rather than just punished. Rehabilitation advocates see this as both humane and practical. Hardliners think serious crimes deserve serious punishment and rehabilitation often fails.	Governance	Rehabilitation vs. Punishment	-1	core	1	ALL	gov		
25	P25	Jobs and education should be awarded strictly on merit, without regard to race, gender, or background.	Only individual ability should determine opportunities, ignoring group identities entirely. Meritocrats see this as true fairness. Critics argue historical discrimination created current disparities and colorblindness perpetuates inequality.	Social	Race and Inequality	1	core	1	ALL	soc		second
26	P26	Men and women naturally have different roles in society that should be respected.	Biological differences mean men and women naturally excel at different tasks and roles. Traditionalists see this as acknowledging reality. Feminists argue most differences are cultural and biological arguments have justified discrimination.	Social	Gender Roles	1	core	1	ALL	soc		
27	P27	Maintaining a strong national culture is more important than embracing global cosmopolitanism.	Preserving distinct national traditions matters more than becoming part of global culture. Nationalists value unique heritage and identity. Cosmopolitans think isolation breeds prejudice and cultures grow through exchange.	Social	National Identity	1	core	1	ALL	soc		
28	P28	Schools should teach children to be proud of their nation and its history.	Children should learn patriotic history that builds love and respect for their country. Patriots think this creates unity and belonging. Educators worry about propaganda, whitewashing problems, and that critical thinking requires honest history.	Social	Patriotism	1	core	1	ALL	soc	yes	
29	P29	The traditional family of one man and one woman raising children is the best foundation for society.	Children need married mother and father for optimal development and social stability. Traditional family advocates cite child welfare. Progressives point to successful diverse families and argue this stigmatizes single parents and same-sex couples.	Social	Family Structure	1	core	1	ALL	soc		first
30	P30	Religious values should guide laws and public policy.	Religious principles provide moral foundation that secular law lacks. Faith-based advocates believe divine guidance creates just society. Secularists argue religious law violates freedom of belief and morality doesn't require religion.	Social	Religion in Public Life	1	core	1	ALL	soc	yes	
31	P31	Nations should confront and atone for past injustices, even if it damages national pride.	Countries must acknowledge historical wrongs like slavery and colonialism to heal and progress.

32	P32	Same-sex couples should have the same legal rights and recognition as opposite-sex couples.	Marriage equality means same-sex couples deserve identical legal recognition as heterosexual couples. LGBT advocates frame this as equal rights. Traditionalists believe marriage has specific meaning and civil unions could provide legal benefits.	Social	LGBTQ+ Rights	-1	core	1	ALL	soc		
33	P33	People should be free to change their legal gender and have it fully recognized in society.	People experiencing gender dysphoria should be able to change legal documents and access appropriate facilities. Trans rights supporters see this as basic dignity and mental health. Skeptics worry about women's spaces, sports fairness, and children's wellbeing.	Social	Trans Rights	-1	core	1	ALL	soc		
34	P34	Immigration and cultural diversity strengthen society.	Immigrants bring new ideas, skills, and energy that benefit receiving countries. Pro-immigration voices celebrate diversity's advantages. Immigration skeptics worry about job competition, cultural cohesion, and strain on public services.	Social	Multiculturalism	-1	core	1	ALL	soc	yes	
35	P35	People should be free to express themselves even if it offends traditional values.	Individual expression shouldn't be limited by others' comfort with tradition. Libertarians value personal freedom and authenticity. Social conservatives think society needs shared standards and unlimited expression undermines social cohesion.	Social	Expression vs. Tradition	-1	core	1	ALL	soc		first
36	P36	Schools should provide comprehensive sex education, including contraception and consent.	Students need accurate information about sexuality, relationships, and safety. Health educators see this as protecting youth and preventing problems. Parent rights advocates want family control over these discussions and worry about age-inappropriate content.	Social	Sex Education	-1	core	1	ALL	soc		second
37	TBE-LC1	Profits mostly exist because workers are unfairly paid less than the value they create.	Workers produce more value than their wages, with the difference becoming owner profits. Labor advocates see exploitation requiring unions or regulation. Capitalists argue owners deserve returns for risk, investment, and coordination.	Economic	Labor & Profit	-1	tiebreaker	1	LEFT_CENTER	econ		
38	TBE-LC2	Strong unions are essential to protect workers, even if they make businesses less efficient.	Without union protection, individual workers have no power against large employers. Union supporters see collective bargaining as essential balance. Free-market advocates think unions protect bad workers, increase costs, and competition protects workers.	Economic	Labor Unions	-1	tiebreaker	1	LEFT_CENTER	econ		
39	TBE-CR1	Big corporations are efficient and successful, not something to be broken up.	Large corporations achieve efficiency through scale and expertise that smaller firms can't match. Corporate defenders see size as natural success. Antitrust advocates worry about monopoly power, political influence, and that breaking up giants increases competition.	Economic	Corporate Size	1	tiebreaker	1	CENTER_RIGHT	econ		
40	TBE-CR2	Maximizing economic growth is more important than reducing inequality.	Growing the economic pie matters more than how it's divided. Growth advocates think expansion eventually helps everyone and redistribution reduces incentives. Equality advocates argue inequality itself slows growth and causes social problems.	Economic	Growth over Equality	1	tiebreaker	1	CENTER_RIGHT	econ	yes	
41	TBA-LC1	People should be free to form any group they like, even if its views are widely unpopular.	Democracy requires allowing even extremist groups to organize and speak freely.

45	ELGA-A-01	Revolutionary movements succeed through centralized command structures.	Revolutions work better when one main group of leaders makes all decisions and everyone else follows orders. This view emphasizes organizational efficiency. Critics worry about power concentration limiting broad participation and democratic input.	Leadership Model	revolution	1	refine	2	EL-GA	ELGA-A		
46	ELGA-A-02	Authentic revolutions arise from spontaneous mass mobilization.	Real revolutions happen when regular people get so angry about their problems that they all rise up together without anyone planning it first. Spontaneous uprising advocates see this as more genuine. Skeptics note it lacks clear goals and planning.	Leadership Model	revolution	-1	refine	2	EL-GA	ELGA-A
