EL-GA	Revolutionary Communism & State Socialism	x: -10.00 to -7.78,  y: 7.78 to 10.00	Bolshevik Marxism	Revolutionary Socialist	Believes only a revolution led by a strong, disciplined party can fully overthrow capitalism and create a socialist society. Gradual reforms or popular protests are seen as inadequate. Only by seizing state power and transforming economic structures through a centralized movement can a true socialist order be built and defended from counterrevolution.	Lenin’s Bolsheviks in the 1917 Russian Revolution created the first lasting communist state, showing how a disciplined revolutionary party could seize power. Their model shaped the 20th century left, and even today, some tiny communist parties in the West cite this period as their historical inspiration.	Trotskyism	Bolshevik Marxism and Trotskyism share a deep commitment to revolution as the means to destroy capitalism and reshape society under worker control.	Maoism	Bolshevik Marxism and Maoism both rely on disciplined parties to lead transformation, differing mainly in whether peasants or urban workers are the key force.	Civic Conservatism	The two share a belief that shared values keep communities together, even if they imagine very different kinds of order.	Objectivism	Both reject passivity and insist society must be reshaped intentionally, though they differ on the end goal.
EL-GA	Revolutionary Communism & State Socialism	x: -7.78 to -5.56,  y: 7.78 to 10.00	Juche	Self-Reliance Ideology	Believes a nation must become entirely self-sufficient and united under a single supreme leader, rejecting foreign influence, outside aid, or global oversight. This worldview envisions complete economic and cultural isolation in order to preserve national purity, framed as the only way to keep the nation secure, independent, and uncorrupted by outsiders.	North Korea under the Kim dynasty remains the clearest living example of total autarky and leader worship. The regime rejects almost all outside influence and enforces strict isolation. While there is no true Western equivalent, its system illustrates the farthest extreme of self-sufficiency and centralized control.	National Bolshevism	Juche and National Bolshevism mix nationalism with state socialism, demanding strict central authority to defend cultural identity and national survival.	Autocratic Theocracy	Like an autocratic theocracy, Juche treats loyalty to its leader as near-spiritual, binding politics and devotion into one system of control.	Progressivism	Each side believes society can be completely remade, though their visions of that future could not be further apart.	Paleoconservatism	Each side distrusts foreign influence, though one seeks purity through isolation and the other through tradition.
EL-GA	Revolutionary Communism & State Socialism	x: -5.56 to -3.33,  y: 7.78 to 10.00	Strasserism	Radical Nationalist Socialist	Combines intense nationalism with radical anti-capitalist beliefs, arguing that foreign corporations and elites exploit the common people. Calls for authoritarian rule to protect ordinary citizens from these forces. Portrays itself as a defender of the working class while using national pride to justify harsh measures and concentrate power at the top.	The Strasser brothers led a radical faction of the early Nazi movement in 1920s Germany that combined nationalism with anti-capitalist rhetoric. Though Hitler sidelined them, their ideas survive as fringe references in some neo-Nazi populist groups, which invoke Strasserism while lacking any real political power today.	Nazism	Strasserism was born inside Nazism, sharing its nationalism and authoritarianism but mixing in radical anti-capitalist ideas rejected by Hitler himself.	National Capitalism	Like National Capitalism, Strasserism saw the economy as a weapon for national revival, ready to use either state control or private power to serve the nation.	Eco-Socialism	These two reject uncontrolled capitalism, though one dreams of purity and the other of sustainability.	Third-Way Labour	These two blend nationalism and socialism with pragmatic economics, even if their morals and methods differ wildly.
EM-GA	Authoritarian Statist Centrism	x: -3.33 to -1.11,  y: 7.78 to 10.00	Falangism	Religious Authoritarian	A clerical fascist ideology that merges authoritarian nationalism with devout Catholic values, calling for the state to enforce moral teachings. Promotes a corporatist economy where industries are overseen by the state in line with religious principles. Imagines a rigid, unified society guided by traditional faith, duty, and obedience to authority.	The Falangist Party of 1930s Spain fused authoritarian nationalism and Catholic traditionalism. It shaped Francisco Franco’s regime and left a cultural imprint. Today, only a handful of small Catholic far-right groups in Europe reference Falangism, and there is no significant Western political movement built on it.	Francoism	Falangism fed Franco’s rule, fusing Catholic tradition with corporatist economics to impose a rigid ideal of national unity and cultural obedience.	Integralism	Falangism and Integralism both aim to embed Catholic faith deep into governance, seeing religion as the glue for social order.	Liberal Conservatism	The pair value order and community, though one seeks it with rigid hierarchy and the other with steady legal norms.	Council Communism	The pair stress collective identity, though one channels it through hierarchy and the other through worker councils.
EM-GA	Authoritarian Statist Centrism	x: -1.11 to 1.11,  y: 7.78 to 10.00	Autocratic Theocracy	Divine Rule Believer	Advocates for a government ruled by a single absolute leader whose authority is justified by religion. Believes that merging divine will with state power produces true order and justice. Opposes secular democracy, seeing it as corrupting and chaotic, and instead envisions a theocratic regime with complete control over law, culture, and society.	Iran’s Supreme Leader system and Saudi Arabia’s royal rule show what modern theocracies look like, where religion legitimizes total authority. No Western democracy has adopted such structures, but these governments illustrate how faith-based leadership can completely merge spiritual power with political rule.	Integralism	Autocratic Theocracy and Integralism fuse religion and state power, claiming moral authority as justification for political control and obedience.	Absolute Monarchy	Like Absolute Monarchy, Autocratic Theocracy trusts a single leader to rule absolutely, but ties their authority to divine or sacred legitimacy.	Progressivism	Each of them believes in remaking society’s values, though one looks forward and the other backward.	Libertarianism	Each of them emphasizes moral principles, though one imposes them and the other leaves them to personal choice.
EM-GA	Authoritarian Statist Centrism	x: 1.11 to 3.33,  y: 7.78 to 10.00	Nazism	Racial Supremacist	Champions an extreme form of racist nationalism in which a totalitarian one-party state seeks to purify the population by excluding or eliminating those it deems inferior. Uses propaganda, surveillance, and violence to maintain control. Frames itself as protecting the nation’s future, while relying on hatred and fear to rally support and enforce unity.	Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler from 1933 to 1945 defined totalitarian fascism, combining racism, propaganda, and violence to create a one-party state. Today, neo-Nazi groups exist only on the fringe without state power, but they continue to reference and glorify Hitler’s failed vision of racial dictatorship.	Fascism	Nazism and Fascism share totalitarian ambition, glorifying the state, militarism, and loyalty while crushing dissent to enforce ideological purity.	Francoism	Nazism and Francoism overlap in their authoritarian nationalism, though Franco’s regime tied itself more to Catholic tradition than Nazi racial ideology.	National Capitalism	Together they see economics as serving the state’s power, even if their visions of society differ.	State Socialism	Both use state control, though for utterly different moral and ideological goals.
ER-GA	Authoritarian Right & Corporatist Monarchism	x: 3.33 to 5.56,  y: 7.78 to 10.00	Francoism	Catholic Authoritarian	Blends authoritarian rule by a strongman leader with conservative Catholic and national traditions, suppressing dissent in the name of preserving social order and religious values. Views freedom of speech and pluralism as destabilizing. Seeks to hold society together through loyalty to traditional faith, hierarchy, and a heavily controlled cultural identity.	Francisco Franco’s dictatorship in Spain from 1939 to 1975 built a lasting example of Catholic-infused authoritarianism. His regime shaped Spanish politics for decades, and although the dictatorship ended, nostalgia groups and symbols linked to Franco still surface occasionally in Spanish far-right movements.	Falangism	Francoism drew heavily from Falangism, adopting its Catholic nationalism and corporatist economy to forge a vision of Spain rooted in obedience and tradition.	Integralism	Francoism and Integralism both saw religion as essential to a functioning society, turning faith into a pillar of national identity and politics.	Civic Conservatism	The two stress the need for shared values to hold society together, though they diverge in how rigidly to enforce them.	Council Communism	The two believe in collective responsibility, though one sees it through faith and hierarchy and the other through workers.
ER-GA	Authoritarian Right & Corporatist Monarchism	x: 5.56 to 7.78,  y: 7.78 to 10.00	Fascism	Totalitarian Nationalist	Demands a nation be fully unified under a powerful leader and a militarized government. Sees glory as achievable only through strict obedience, national expansion, and crushing opposition. Uses intimidation and violence to enforce order and loyalty, believing sacrifice for the leader and the state is the highest duty of every citizen.	Benito Mussolini’s Italy in the 1920s and 1930s created the blueprint for fascism, combining mass rallies, militarism, and one-party rule. Modern ultra-nationalist and neo-fascist groups borrow his symbols and ideas, but no Western government today openly adopts Mussolini’s model of governance or his ideology.	Nazism	Fascism and Nazism share authoritarian rule, state glorification, and ruthless control, though Nazism adds an extreme racial agenda not central to all fascism.	Francoism	Like Francoism, Fascism relied on tradition, nationalism, and hierarchy, though its tone was often more revolutionary and militaristic.	Distributism	Each side dislikes pure laissez faire economics, though one uses that to build hierarchy and the other to build localism.	Progressivism	Together they seek sweeping social transformation, even if their end goals are polar opposites.
ER-GA	Authoritarian Right & Corporatist Monarchism	x: 7.78 to 10.00,  y: 7.78 to 10.00	Absolute Monarchy	Unchecked Royal Rule	Believes a single hereditary monarch should hold total and unchecked power by divine right. Rejects democratic checks, representative government, or power sharing of any kind. The monarch rules as the embodiment of the state, with subjects bound to obey. Sees tradition, birthright, and religion as the sole sources of legitimate authority.	Historic European kingdoms such as Louis XIV’s France during the “Sun King” era demonstrated absolute monarchy, with rulers claiming divine right and unlimited power. Today, absolute monarchies like Saudi Arabia and Brunei persist, but no modern Western state retains that structure of unchecked hereditary rule.	Autocratic Theocracy	Absolute Monarchy and Autocratic Theocracy both place supreme power in one leader, who claims legitimacy through divine will or sacred duty.	Feudalism	Absolute Monarchy and Feudalism share a hierarchical worldview, seeing society as a ladder of obligations and loyalty beneath a single sovereign.	Civic Conservatism	These two cherish order and inherited tradition, though they disagree on how unchanging that order must be.	Georgism	Both involve concepts of land stewardship, though one holds it by divine right and the other for public benefit.
EL-GA	Revolutionary Communism & State Socialism	x: -10.00 to -7.78,  y: 5.56 to 7.78	Maoism	Rural Communist Revolutionary	Favors a communist revolution led by rural peasants rather than urban workers, inspired by Mao Zedong’s model. Sees the countryside as the revolutionary heart of society, capable of overthrowing landlords and elites. Promotes continuous struggle, mass mobilization, and cultural transformation to create a socialist state rooted in collective rural power.	Mao Zedong’s China during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s showed the power of rural-led revolution, mass mobilization, and cultural upheaval. Decades later, Maoist guerrilla groups like Peru’s Shining Path in the 1980s drew on his ideas, showing how his influence extended well beyond China’s borders.	Bolshevik Marxism	Maoism and Bolshevik Marxism share faith in revolutionary parties but differ in focus, with Maoism turning peasants into the heart of socialist struggle.	Posadism	Both Maoism and Posadism see radical upheaval as necessary, though Posadism veers into fantastical territory with visions of nuclear war and alien aid.	Progressivism	The pair insist society can be transformed completely, though one builds through reform and the other through revolution.	Traditional Conservatism	The pair value community loyalty, though one looks toward the past and the other toward the revolutionary future.
EL-GA	Revolutionary Communism & State Socialism	x: -7.78 to -5.56,  y: 5.56 to 7.78	National Bolshevism	Red-and-Black Nationalist	Mixes far-left communist economics with ultra-nationalist politics, calling for strict state control of industries and resources to achieve socialism while also demanding fierce loyalty to the nation. Rejects both free markets and global socialism, seeking instead a system that combines national pride with collective ownership and heavy-handed governance.	The National Bolshevik Party in post-Soviet Russia in the 1990s, led by Eduard Limonov, mixed communism with nationalism. Though fringe, it gained a small following among radicals. While Eastern Europe saw some influence, this ideology remains marginal and has no mainstream presence in the modern Western world.	Juche	National Bolshevism and Juche blend nationalism and socialism, demanding absolute control to shield their nations from outside influence and decay.	State Socialism	Both National Bolshevism and State Socialism turn to central planning to direct the economy, trusting state power to preserve their vision of order.	Paleoconservatism	Each of them distrusts globalization, though one seeks tradition and the other a radical state vision.	Progressivism	Each of them sees society as malleable, though one imagines authoritarian rebirth and the other reform.
EL-GA	Revolutionary Communism & State Socialism	x: -5.56 to -3.33,  y: 5.56 to 7.78	Ba'athism	Pan-Arab Socialist	Seeks to unify multiple nations, originally conceived for the Arab world, under one secular, socialist-leaning authoritarian state. Promises social welfare and equality while concentrating power in a single ruling party. Frames itself as anti-colonial and modernizing but tolerates little dissent and expects absolute loyalty to the new centralized authority.	Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and Hafez and Bashar al-Assad’s Syria built secular authoritarian regimes with Ba’athist ideology, promising unity and socialism. These systems shaped the Middle East but have no Western counterpart. Their mix of nationalism, one-party rule, and repression is regionally specific and rarely replicated elsewhere.	State Socialism	Ba'athism and State Socialism share a faith in central authority to shape society and economy, combining control with promises of equality.	National Capitalism	Both Ba'athism and National Capitalism see economic strength as key to national identity, mixing state direction with national pride.	Liberal Conservatism	The two focus on preserving their vision of stability, even if the content of that vision differs.	Social Libertarianism	Both imagine reshaping power for the community, though in very different ways.
EM-GA	Authoritarian Statist Centrism	x: -3.33 to -1.11,  y: 5.56 to 7.78	State Socialism	State-Run Economy Advocate	Believes a powerful state should own or tightly control essential industries, provide extensive social programs, and manage the economy to ensure fairness and security. Promises equality and stability but leaves little room for competition or dissent, trusting the government to deliver prosperity while preventing private power from dominating public life.	Nordic economies, with their mix of capitalism, state intervention, and generous welfare, hint at elements of state-led fairness. Politicians like Bernie Sanders point to them when promoting policies like universal healthcare. While democratic, these countries showcase a softer but still interventionist approach to governance.	Socialism	State Socialism and Socialism share the goal of common ownership, though State Socialism places that power squarely in the hands of the government.	Democratic Socialism	Both support public control of resources to ensure fairness, differing mostly in how democracy plays a role in that control.	Civic Conservatism	Together they care about shared responsibility, though they define it differently.	Paleo-Libertarianism	The two criticize big global forces, though they draw opposite conclusions.
EM-GA	Authoritarian Statist Centrism	x: -1.11 to 1.11,  y: 5.56 to 7.78	Integralism	Church-Guided Statist	Advocates for a state deeply tied to traditional religion, often Catholicism, and structured to enforce moral values from the top down. Promotes an economy organized into state-managed “corporate” groups of workers and owners. Believes order and virtue come from hierarchy, faith, and obedience, with personal freedoms secondary to spiritual and national goals.	Portuguese leader António de Oliveira Salazar’s Estado Novo regime in the mid-20th century promoted integralism: Catholic hierarchy fused with authoritarian rule. Today, only a handful of Catholic intellectual circles in Europe and the United States reference neo-integralism as a cultural ideal rather than an active political movement.	Falangism	Integralism and Falangism weave religion into the state, seeing faith as the foundation for national unity and social discipline.	Autocratic Theocracy	Both rely on sacred authority to justify power, treating politics as an extension of moral duty and devotion.	Progressivism	Each side aims to reshape culture’s core, though one revives tradition and the other reinvents it.	Civil Libertarianism	Each side cares deeply about values, but one enforces them and the other frees them.
EM-GA	Authoritarian Statist Centrism	x: 1.11 to 3.33,  y: 5.56 to 7.78	State Capitalism	Government-Directed Capitalist	Endorses a mostly capitalist economy but wants the state to own or oversee major industries to serve national goals. Believes some sectors should prioritize the country over profit. This model mixes private enterprise with state intervention, creating a blurred line between business and government and prioritizing national strength above free markets.	Modern China’s mix of state-owned giants and market reforms illustrates state capitalism, with government-backed industries competing in markets. Western parallels include mid-20th-century Gaullist France, where nationalized industries operated alongside private ones, though no Western country today replicates China’s exact model.	Authoritarian Capitalism	State Capitalism and Authoritarian Capitalism use markets for national strength, letting the state steer industry for strategic goals.	National Capitalism	Both see the economy as a servant of state power, blending ownership models to advance national priorities.	Progressivism	These two believe policy can transform economies, even if their aims are worlds apart.	Traditional Conservatism	Both value order, though one builds it from markets and the other from heritage.
ER-GA	Authoritarian Right & Corporatist Monarchism	x: 3.33 to 5.56,  y: 5.56 to 7.78	Constitutional Monarchy	Ceremonial Monarch Supporter	Supports a system where a king or queen remains head of state but their role is limited by a constitution and an elected parliament. Symbolizes tradition and continuity, while real governing power rests with democratic institutions. Balances ceremonial monarchy with functional democracy, preserving heritage without abandoning representative rule.	The United Kingdom, Japan, and Sweden maintain constitutional monarchies today, where the king or queen is mostly ceremonial, and elected governments hold power. These systems balance heritage with democracy, showing how traditional monarchies evolved into symbolic roles within fully functioning democratic states.	Civic Conservatism	Constitutional Monarchy and Civic Conservatism share faith in institutions and gradual reform, tying stability to respect for tradition and law.	Liberal Democracy	Both rely on elected governments for real power, leaving the monarch as a cultural anchor rather than a ruler.	Distributism	The pair stress balance, though one frames it in politics and the other in property.	Libertarianism	The pair tolerate individual freedom, even if one does so under a ceremonial crown.
ER-GA	Authoritarian Right & Corporatist Monarchism	x: 5.56 to 7.78,  y: 5.56 to 7.78	Feudalism	Medieval Hierarchist	Follows a medieval-style hierarchy where kings grant land to nobles in exchange for loyalty and service, while peasants labor for protection. Society is organized around rigid obligations and duties, with little personal freedom. This worldview romanticizes feudal order, seeing it as stable and honorable, even though it imposes strict class divisions.	Europe during the Middle Ages, such as 12th-century England or France, ran on feudalism: kings granted land to nobles in exchange for loyalty, and peasants worked under rigid duties. Today, no country operates under this system, and it survives mainly in historical reenactments and fantasy literature.	Absolute Monarchy	Feudalism and Absolute Monarchy share a rigid hierarchy built on loyalty and land, where power is inherited and obligations bind every layer of society.	Anarcho-Feudalism	Both imagine rule by localized lords, with relationships of service and protection forming the core of social order.	Distributism	Each of them cares about local ties and small scale stewardship, though with different power dynamics.	Georgism	Both link land to responsibility, though in very different contexts.
ER-GA	Authoritarian Right & Corporatist Monarchism	x: 7.78 to 10.00,  y: 5.56 to 7.78	Authoritarian Capitalism	Dictator’s Market Model	Prefers a dictatorship or harsh authoritarian government that maintains law and order while still allowing capitalism and private enterprise to thrive. Markets function under tight state oversight, ensuring profits do not undermine the regime. Promotes nationalism and control over society while tolerating business activity if it serves the leader’s goals.	Chile under General Pinochet from 1973 to 1990 is a striking example of authoritarian capitalism. He imposed free-market reforms while ruling with fear. Singapore is sometimes cited as a softer case: strict rules and a pro-business climate, but without Pinochet’s level of brutality or political repression.	State Capitalism	Authoritarian Capitalism and State Capitalism embrace markets but bend them to state power, using industry to serve political goals.	National Capitalism	Both see the economy as a tool for national ambition, mixing control and enterprise as needed.	Liberal Conservatism	The two like orderly markets, though one manages them heavily and the other lightly.	Progressivism	Each of them sees the state as shaping the future, though with opposing motives.
EL-GA	Revolutionary Communism & State Socialism	x: -10.00 to -7.78,  y: 3.33 to 5.56	Trotskyism	Global Revolutionary Socialist	Calls for endless international revolution to spread socialism worldwide, rejecting any idea of building socialism in only one country. Sees compromise as betrayal, and authoritarian distortions as dangerous. Believes socialism must constantly expand and renew itself, with workers everywhere rising together to create a borderless socialist future.	Leon Trotsky and his followers in the Fourth International championed global revolution, insisting socialism could not remain in one country. Today, small Trotskyist parties in the West, like the UK Socialist Workers Party, continue this mission, advocating for worker uprisings worldwide despite having little influence.	Bolshevik Marxism	Trotskyism and Bolshevik Marxism share revolutionary roots, pushing for global worker uprisings and rejecting complacency under capitalism.	Luxemburgism	Trotskyism and Luxemburgism both prize democracy in revolution, even while pushing for deep systemic change.	Progressivism	These two believe in constant social progress, though one through reform and the other through revolt.	Civic Conservatism	The two value shared duties, though they define those duties differently.
EL-GA	Revolutionary Communism & State Socialism	x: -7.78 to -5.56,  y: 3.33 to 5.56	Left-Wing Nationalism	Socialist Patriot	Blends socialist economic policies like wealth redistribution and state welfare with passionate national pride and independence movements. Often arises in anti-colonial or liberation struggles. Promises equality and unity while insisting on freedom from foreign control, using socialism not only to change the economy but also to build cultural identity.	Leaders like Ho Chi Minh blended communism with nationalism to fight colonialism, inspiring movements worldwide. In the West, some Irish republican factions adopted similar socialist-patriotic ideals. These examples show how left-wing ideas combined with independence struggles to fuel resistance movements against foreign rule.	Juche	Left-Wing Nationalism and Juche tie love of country to socialist ideals, blending identity and equity into one narrative of liberation.	National Bolshevism	Both mix nationalism with radical economics, seeking to free their nations from outside dominance.	Traditional Conservatism	The pair stress loyalty to the nation, though one preserves the past and the other rewrites it.	Liberalism	Together they speak of freedom, though with different visions of who and what that includes.
EL-GA	Revolutionary Communism & State Socialism	x: -5.56 to -3.33,  y: 3.33 to 5.56	Longism	Populist Wealth-Sharer	Draws on Huey Long’s ideas of heavy taxation on the rich and large corporations to fund generous social programs for ordinary citizens. Envisions a charismatic, centralized leader using state power to “share the wealth.” Promises fairness and uplift for the poor while relying on strong, sometimes authoritarian leadership to impose its vision.	Huey Long’s rule in Louisiana during the 1920s and 1930s embodied populism with heavy taxes on the rich and “share the wealth” programs. Modern left populists echo his rhetoric about taxing the wealthy, but none wield his level of centralized power or authoritarian control to enforce their agenda.	Distributism	Longism and Distributism share suspicion of concentrated wealth, preferring broad property ownership and programs to uplift ordinary people.	Democratic Socialism	Both Longism and Democratic Socialism seek fairness by taxing the rich to fund services for the poor, though Longism is more centralized.	Civic Conservatism	Each side values strong communities, though one seeks them through reform and the other through duty.	National Capitalism	Both want economic direction, though their end goals differ.
EM-GA	Authoritarian Statist Centrism	x: -3.33 to -1.11,  y: 3.33 to 5.56	Distributism	Small-Property Advocate	Promotes the Catholic-inspired idea that widespread ownership of property by families and cooperatives creates a more just society. Opposes giant monopolies and overly centralized states alike. Advocates for local businesses, family farms, and community-led efforts, aiming for an economy that is neither dominated by corporations nor smothered by bureaucracy.	Writers G.K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc promoted distributism in the early 20th century, arguing for widespread property ownership by families and cooperatives. Today, their influence lingers in some localist economic movements, credit unions, and community farming efforts that reject both corporate monopolies and heavy state control.	Longism	Distributism and Longism share the belief that spreading wealth widely creates fairness, favoring small businesses and local ownership over monopolies.	Civic Conservatism	Both Distributism and Civic Conservatism value family, community, and responsibility, seeing them as core to a healthy society.	Anarcho-Mutualism	These two prefer local control of property, though their routes there differ sharply.	Traditional Conservatism	The pair honor heritage, though one envisions smaller scale ownership.
EM-GA	Authoritarian Statist Centrism	x: -1.11 to 1.11,  y: 3.33 to 5.56	State Liberalism	Top-Down Reformer	Believes a strong centralized government should impose liberal reforms such as secularization, modernization, and social progress from above. Sees gradual democracy as too slow or unreliable. Prioritizes swift reform, trusting elites to guide society toward equality and progress, while allowing limited public input and tolerating few obstacles to change.	Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s Turkey in the 1920s and 1930s forced rapid secular reforms, dismantling Ottoman traditions to modernize society. Singapore under Lee Kuan Yew later mirrored this blend of authoritarian direction and modernization. Both cases show how states can tightly steer cultural and economic transformation.	Social Liberalism	State Liberalism and Social Liberalism share trust in government to secure individual rights and well-being, using policy to ensure fairness.	Progressivism	Both believe laws can drive change and expand opportunity, shaping society through reform and state action.	Liberal Conservatism	Together they rely on rules for stability, though one reforms them more often.	Centrism	Each of them seeks balance, though their mix of market and state differs.
EM-GA	Authoritarian Statist Centrism	x: 1.11 to 3.33,  y: 3.33 to 5.56	Civic Conservatism	Community-Minded Conservative	Emphasizes preserving traditional values while strengthening local communities and civil society. Promotes volunteerism and personal responsibility instead of relying on a large state. Values cultural continuity, family, and service to neighbors, believing that civic duty and strong local bonds are the foundation of a healthy and stable society.	Britain’s “Big Society” initiative under David Cameron encouraged volunteerism and local action, echoing civic conservatism. In the U.S., George H.W. Bush’s “thousand points of light” message similarly promoted community service. These examples show conservative leaders appealing to civic duty while limiting state intervention.	Traditional Conservatism	Civic Conservatism and Traditional Conservatism share respect for heritage and responsibility, aiming for continuity and careful change.	Liberal Conservatism	Both Civic and Liberal Conservatism tie community values to steady governance, stressing social order and gradual reform.	Socialism	The pair talk of duty to others, though one roots it in community and the other in class.	Libertarianism	Both admire voluntary action, though one frames it with tradition.
ER-GA	Authoritarian Right & Corporatist Monarchism	x: 3.33 to 5.56,  y: 3.33 to 5.56	Right-Wing Nationalism	Hardline Patriot	Strongly prioritizes national sovereignty, cultural traditions, and law and order. Often supports strict immigration limits and protectionist trade policies to shield domestic industries. Portrays itself as defending the nation from outside threats and unwanted changes, framing patriotism and loyalty to heritage as essential to preserving identity.	Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda and European nationalist parties like Marine Le Pen’s National Rally represent modern nationalist conservatism. They push for tighter borders, economic protection, and cultural preservation. While they differ in tone and intensity, both reflect the same broad political current in today’s West.	Paleoconservatism	Right-Wing Nationalism and Paleoconservatism both emphasize cultural preservation and skepticism of global influence, tying identity to a shared national story.	National Capitalism	Both see economic policy as a tool to fortify national pride and strength, shaping markets to defend sovereignty and protect their vision of heritage.	Progressivism	Each side seeks sweeping change, though one builds backward and the other forward.	Liberalism	These two value freedom in rhetoric, but frame it very differently.
ER-GA	Authoritarian Right & Corporatist Monarchism	x: 5.56 to 7.78,  y: 3.33 to 5.56	Paleoconservatism	Old-Guard Conservative	Yearns for an older, stricter form of conservatism. Champions traditional values, isolationist foreign policy, and limited immigration while distrusting globalization and military interventions abroad. Seeks to return to a world of clear hierarchies and familiar norms, skeptical of rapid change and wary of entanglements beyond the nation’s borders.	In the U.S., Pat Buchanan in the 1990s embodied paleoconservatism, stressing isolationism and cultural traditionalism. Figures like Steve Bannon later echoed some of his themes in the Trump era. Though less dominant today, these ideas still shape pockets of the right-wing political conversation in America.	Traditional Conservatism	Paleoconservatism and Traditional Conservatism prize heritage, faith, and duty, resisting the pull of globalism and rapid cultural transformation.	Right-Wing Nationalism	Both stress sovereignty and national identity, wary of outside forces reshaping their culture or weakening their sense of rootedness.	Juche	The two distrust foreign influence, though for entirely different reasons.	Georgism	Each side looks to land for meaning, though one seeks heritage and the other fairness.
ER-GA	Authoritarian Right & Corporatist Monarchism	x: 7.78 to 10.00,  y: 3.33 to 5.56	National Capitalism	Protectionist Capitalist	Advocates a capitalist economy designed to strengthen the nation and protect domestic industries from global competition. Supports tariffs, industrial policy, and strategic state partnerships to achieve self-sufficiency. Frames economic nationalism as essential for sovereignty, arguing that unfettered free trade weakens the country and its workers.	Trump-era trade policies, including tariffs and a “buy American” push, revived old economic nationalism. Historical precedents include 19th-century U.S. tariff protections and France’s industrial planning under Charles de Gaulle. Together, these cases show how states mix patriotism with economic strategy to shelter domestic industries.	Authoritarian Capitalism	National Capitalism and Authoritarian Capitalism both tie economic policy to state authority, bending markets to national purpose rather than leaving them free.	State Capitalism	Both see the state directing the economy when needed, merging private and public control for strategic goals and cultural security.	Progressivism	These two see markets as tools to be guided, even if the direction differs.	Libertarianism	Both talk of freedom, though one means national and the other personal.
EL-GM	Democratic Socialism & Left Populism	x: -10.00 to -7.78,  y: 1.11 to 3.33	Posadism	Space-Age Communist	An ultra-fringe communist offshoot that bizarrely embraces nuclear war as a way to spark global revolution. Believes mass destruction could wipe away capitalism and open a path to socialism. Some even speculate that alien beings might help achieve utopia afterward. Exists mostly as a fringe theory, often treated with skepticism or dark humor.	J. Posadas, an Argentine Trotskyist from the 1960s, created one of the strangest ideological offshoots by suggesting nuclear war could spark socialism and even speculating that aliens might aid humanity afterward. Today, his ideas survive mostly as an online meme rather than any organized or serious political effort.	Trotskyism	Posadism grows out of Trotskyism, sharing its call for world revolution but layering on surreal ideas like nuclear war and alien help to reach communism.	Maoism	Like Maoism, Posadism sees upheaval as necessary for transformation, though its imagined forces are far stranger than peasant armies.	Progressivism	The pair expect transformation, though Posadism’s vision is fantastical.	Eco-Socialism	The pair tie humanity’s fate to sweeping change, even if one imagines UFOs.
EL-GM	Democratic Socialism & Left Populism	x: -7.78 to -5.56,  y: 1.11 to 3.33	Socialism	Shared Economy Advocate	Believes that major industries and resources should be owned or strictly regulated by the community, usually through the state or cooperatives. Seeks to ensure wealth is distributed fairly and everyone’s needs are met. Promotes economic equality and social welfare while curbing unchecked private power, but risks inefficiency through heavy oversight.	Many European countries have socialist-inspired parties, like France’s Socialist Party or the historic UK Labour platform. In the U.S., Bernie Sanders’ movement brought socialist ideas like Medicare for All into mainstream debate. While democratic, these efforts reflect a lasting thread of socialist thinking in Western politics.	Democratic Socialism	Socialism and Democratic Socialism share the aim of shared ownership and fairness, differing mainly in whether democracy is their chosen path forward.	State Socialism	Both envision public control of resources to end inequality, but State Socialism relies more heavily on centralized power to deliver it.	Civic Conservatism	Each of them stresses duty to the group, though for very different ideals.	Distributism	Each of them values spreading resources, though in distinct ways.
EL-GM	Democratic Socialism & Left Populism	x: -5.56 to -3.33,  y: 1.11 to 3.33	Democratic Socialism	Ballot-Box Socialist	Seeks to achieve socialist principles like public ownership and extensive welfare gradually through democratic elections instead of violent revolution. Promotes reforms and social programs while respecting institutions and avoiding authoritarian control. Frames democracy as a vehicle for socialism, aiming for fairness without sacrificing freedoms or rights.	Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez call themselves democratic socialists while working through elections. In Europe, similar parties govern by expanding welfare and public services. These movements prove that socialism can operate within democratic systems, reshaping policy without dismantling representative government or relying on revolution.	Social Democracy	Democratic Socialism and Social Democracy share the belief that markets can coexist with public control to ensure equity and protect citizens’ welfare.	Socialism	Both push for shared ownership and redistribution, with Democratic Socialism relying more on elections to achieve its aims.	Civic Conservatism	Together they care about community bonds, though they define them differently.	Liberal Conservatism	Together they mix tradition and reform, but with very different balances.
EM-GM	Mixed-Economy Liberal Center	x: -3.33 to -1.11,  y: 1.11 to 3.33	Social Liberalism	Rights-Focused Reformer	Combines support for civil liberties and individual rights with backing for a regulated capitalist economy and a strong safety net. Believes government should protect freedoms while ensuring opportunity and basic security for all. Promotes both personal autonomy and social responsibility, creating a middle ground between laissez-faire and full socialism.	Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal in the 1930s reshaped U.S. politics, mixing liberal reforms with economic intervention. Canada’s Liberal Party and the UK’s Liberal Democrats continue this tradition, showing how social liberalism uses government to protect rights, regulate markets, and cushion citizens from economic hardship.	State Liberalism	Social Liberalism and State Liberalism both call on government to uphold rights and expand opportunity, trusting reform to build a fairer society.	Progressivism	Both push steady legal change to address inequality, sharing faith in public policy as a tool to solve social problems.	Traditional Conservatism	These two value moral duty, though one frames it in reform and one in roots.	Distributism	Both seek fairness, though in different tones.
EM-GM	Mixed-Economy Liberal Center	x: -1.11 to 1.11,  y: 1.11 to 3.33	Third-Way Labour	Market-Friendly Progressive	Represents a center-left vision that embraces free markets and globalization but balances them with social programs and protections. Rejects old-school socialism while still addressing inequality through reform. Seeks to combine the growth of capitalism with fairness, offering a “third way” that claims to modernize both the economy and welfare systems.	Tony Blair’s New Labour in Britain and Bill Clinton’s New Democrats in the U.S. rebranded center-left politics in the 1990s. They promoted business-friendly policies while keeping social programs. These “third way” leaders defined a pragmatic middle ground, rejecting old socialism without fully embracing laissez-faire economics.	Neoliberalism	Third-Way Labour and Neoliberalism accept globalization and markets but soften them with welfare programs, searching for a pragmatic middle path.	Social Liberalism	Both see reform as balancing freedom and security, moderating extremes by blending market energy with social protections.	Distributism	Each side favors balance in economics, though with very different roots.	Right-Wing Nationalism	Each side talks of identity, though one seeks openness and one borders.
EM-GM	Mixed-Economy Liberal Center	x: 1.11 to 3.33,  y: 1.11 to 3.33	Neo-Conservatism	Foreign Policy Hawk	Advocates using national power, including military force, to spread values like democracy and capitalism abroad, while maintaining a conservative stance at home. Supports intervention in the name of security and ideals, even if controversial. Frames its actions as safeguarding freedom, though critics see it as overreach that imposes its worldview globally.	The George W. Bush administration featured prominent neoconservatives like Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz, who argued the U.S. should spread democracy abroad, leading to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Earlier thinkers like Irving Kristol laid the foundation. This movement left a deep mark on 21st-century U.S. foreign policy.	Conservatism	Neo-Conservatism and Conservatism share a core respect for tradition and order, though Neo-Conservatism adds intervention abroad to spread ideals.	Liberal Conservatism	Both blend markets with tradition, but Neo-Conservatism uses power overseas to defend its version of those values.	Progressivism	The two believe in shaping the world, though their aims differ sharply.	Social Democracy	Both see global roles for states, but their missions diverge.
ER-GM	Conservative Capitalism & National Conservatism	x: 3.33 to 5.56,  y: 1.11 to 3.33	Conservatism	Mainstream Right	Favors preserving long-standing traditions and institutions while allowing only gradual, cautious change. Supports free markets and strong defense, seeing these as part of stability. Stresses law, order, and family values, portraying itself as a steady hand against upheaval, and warning that too much reform risks unraveling the social fabric.	The U.S. Republican Party under Ronald Reagan and Britain’s Conservative Party under leaders like David Cameron exemplify mainstream conservatism. They combined free markets, strong defense, and traditional values. These leaders shaped the dominant center-right framework in the modern West and continue to influence political debates.	Traditional Conservatism	Conservatism and Traditional Conservatism share a belief in stability, respect for heritage, and cautious, deliberate change when necessary.	Liberal Conservatism	Both blend trust in markets with cultural continuity, holding that freedom must rest on a foundation of shared values.	Distributism	The pair honor small scale ties, though one frames them as duty.	Progressivism	The pair care deeply about society’s future, though they see it differently.
ER-GM	Conservative Capitalism & National Conservatism	x: 5.56 to 7.78,  y: 1.11 to 3.33	Elective Monarchy	Chosen Monarch Supporter	Supports a monarchy or lifetime head of state chosen by a select council rather than by birth. The monarch rules for life but gains authority through elite election instead of bloodline. Blends ceremonial tradition with political control, creating a hybrid between elective legitimacy and authoritarian power that rarely exists in modern states.	The Pope in Vatican City is an elective monarch, chosen by cardinals rather than inheriting power. Historically, the Holy Roman Emperor was also elected by a group of elites. Modern elective monarchies are rare outside ceremonial roles, but these examples show how leaders can be chosen for life by councils.	Absolute Monarchy	Elective Monarchy and Absolute Monarchy both concentrate power in one ruler, differing mainly in how that ruler is chosen, by blood or by vote.	Constitutional Monarchy	Both keep crowns as symbols of legitimacy, though Elective Monarchies can give more authority to those they enthrone.	Libertarianism	Together they can leave daily life to local rule, though in very different ways.	Distributism	Each of them focuses on shared stability, though one uses crowns and one land.
ER-GM	Conservative Capitalism & National Conservatism	x: 7.78 to 10.00,  y: 1.11 to 3.33	Corporatism	State-and-Business Coordinator	Believes society should be organized into corporate groups such as industry and labor syndicates, each integrated into the state. Envisions government, business, and workers cooperating under state direction to avoid class conflict. Promises harmony and efficiency but subordinates individual choice to collective structures managed from above.	Mussolini’s Italy created corporatism, where the state oversaw business and labor groups to avoid class conflict. While no country today fully follows this model, modern “neo-corporatist” systems in parts of Europe, where governments broker deals between unions and businesses, faintly echo that older economic arrangement.	Falangism	Corporatism and Falangism both imagine society as organized by syndicates and groups, woven into the state to prevent conflict and enforce order.	Integralism	Both mix moral or religious guidance with collective economic planning, folding values into how work and governance are arranged.	Anarcho-Syndicalism	These two value worker groups, though one binds them to the state.	Socialism	Both dislike raw competition, but one directs and the other shares.
EL-GM	Democratic Socialism & Left Populism	x: -10.00 to -7.78,  y: -1.11 to 1.11	Orthodox Marxism	Strict Marxist	Strictly follows Karl Marx’s original theories that capitalism will collapse under class struggle, leading first to socialism and then communism. Rejects authoritarian shortcuts in favor of education and mass worker movements. Views history as an inevitable march toward classless society, with revolution driven by the people rather than an elite vanguard.	Karl Kautsky and the Second International shaped Marxist orthodoxy before World War I, insisting socialism should grow through mass movements and democracy, not coups. Today, small parties like the Socialist Party of Great Britain uphold these classical ideas, rejecting Leninist or Maoist deviations as distortions of Marx’s original thought.	Classical Marxism	Orthodox Marxism and Classical Marxism share a strict reading of Marx, holding that capitalism must collapse into socialism through worker struggle.	Luxemburgism	Both reject shortcuts to revolution, emphasizing education, agitation, and mass participation over authoritarian centralism.	Progressivism	Each of them sees history as moving forward, though at very different speeds.	Distributism	The two oppose extreme inequality, though with different visions.
EL-GM	Democratic Socialism & Left Populism	x: -7.78 to -5.56,  y: -1.11 to 1.11	Market Socialism	Cooperative Market Advocate	Envisions a socialist economy where workers or the public own and manage enterprises, but markets and competition still exist. Prices guide decisions like in capitalism, but profits serve society instead of shareholders. Tries to blend the efficiency of markets with the fairness of socialism, aiming for a hybrid model that avoids extremes.	Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito experimented with worker-managed firms in the 1960s, combining socialism with some market elements. Spain’s Mondragón cooperatives continue this approach, showing that workers can own and run businesses while still competing in markets. This hybrid model remains one of the more enduring socialist experiments.	Social Democracy	Market Socialism and Social Democracy both see markets as useful but in need of guardrails, balancing competition with public or worker ownership.	Democratic Socialism	Both aim to fuse equality with economic vitality, using public control to distribute wealth while still harnessing market energy.	Distributism	The two like broad ownership, though one uses markets and one small plots.	Liberalism	Each side values fairness, though one is far more structural.
EL-GM	Democratic Socialism & Left Populism	x: -5.56 to -3.33,  y: -1.11 to 1.11	Labour Liberalism	Worker-Friendly Liberal	Promotes a liberal democratic outlook that prioritizes labor rights and social justice. Strongly supports unions, fair wages, and welfare policies while keeping capitalism as the base system. Seeks to reform the economy from within, arguing that workers deserve dignity and security without dismantling the overall structure of free enterprise.	The early Progressive Era in the U.S. and Roosevelt’s New Deal improved labor rights without abandoning capitalism. Leaders like Hubert Humphrey and British social liberals continued this legacy. These cases illustrate how gradual reform, not revolution, can expand protections for workers while preserving democratic institutions.	Social Liberalism	Labour Liberalism and Social Liberalism trust government to balance worker rights with market energy, ensuring fairness without stifling growth.	Liberalism	Both believe in individual rights, layering in protections for labor to make markets work more fairly for everyone involved.	Distributism	Together they value fairness in ownership, though they differ on how to get it.	Progressivism	These two call for reform, though with different focuses.
EM-GM	Mixed-Economy Liberal Center	x: -3.33 to -1.11,  y: -1.11 to 1.11	Liberalism	Individual Rights Advocate	Represents classic Western liberal democracy committed to freedom, the rule of law, and a mixed economy. Accepts mostly capitalist markets but relies on government to provide education, infrastructure, and a safety net. Frames itself as the balance between liberty and stability, believing rights and institutions must protect both individuals and society.	Most Western governments today reflect liberal principles, from Barack Obama’s policies to Emmanuel Macron’s. They combine free markets with civil liberties and welfare programs. This balanced model, blending individual rights and economic pragmatism, has become the default framework for governance in much of the modern democratic world.	Social Liberalism	Liberalism and Social Liberalism both protect personal freedom and believe in government’s role to balance markets with fairness for all citizens.	Classical Liberalism	Both Liberalism and Classical Liberalism share a core of individual rights and free markets, though Liberalism invites more social intervention.	Distributism	Each side wants fairness for individuals, though one looks to markets and one to land.	Civic Conservatism	Both trust in community responsibility, though they frame it differently.
EM-GM	Mixed-Economy Liberal Center	x: -1.11 to 1.11,  y: -1.11 to 1.11	Centrism	Pragmatic Moderate	Rejects extreme ideologies on the left or right, instead seeking compromise and practical solutions. Blends policies from both sides, mixing market freedom with welfare and regulation as needed. Frames centrism as realism, favoring gradual adjustments and middle-ground solutions over radical changes or ideological purity in governing.	Leaders like Joe Biden in the U.S. or Angela Merkel in Germany govern from the center, borrowing ideas from left and right. They avoid extremes, favoring incremental reforms and compromises. These figures embody centrist politics, which prizes stability and consensus rather than dramatic ideological swings or upheaval.	Liberal Democracy	Centrism and Liberal Democracy both prize moderation and balance, mixing policies from all sides to maintain stability and avoid extremes.	Third-Way Labour	Both Centrism and Third-Way Labour avoid ideological rigidity, blending free markets with welfare to keep society steady and pragmatic.	Juche	The pair think strategy matters, though one seeks balance and one isolation.	Falangism	The pair talk of unity, but with radically different meanings.
EM-GM	Mixed-Economy Liberal Center	x: 1.11 to 3.33,  y: -1.11 to 1.11	Neoliberalism	Market Reformer	Prioritizes free-market policies worldwide, pushing for privatization, deregulation, and reduced state spending on welfare. Argues that competition and trade lead to growth and prosperity. Frames itself as modernizing and efficient, but critics warn it can deepen inequality and weaken protections for vulnerable groups in the pursuit of unfettered markets.	Margaret Thatcher in the U.K. and Ronald Reagan in the U.S. pushed neoliberalism in the 1980s, slashing taxes, deregulating industries, and opening markets. Groups like the IMF spread these policies globally. While controversial, this agenda reshaped economies and remains a powerful influence on modern economic thinking.	Liberal Capitalism	Neoliberalism and Liberal Capitalism both seek to unleash markets and minimize regulation, trusting competition to produce prosperity.	Third-Way Labour	Both Neoliberalism and Third-Way Labour support globalization and markets, differing mainly in how much welfare they wrap around them.	Eco-Socialism	These two think globally, though one for markets and one for the planet.	Georgism	Each of them likes efficient use of land and capital, though for opposite ends.
ER-GM	Conservative Capitalism & National Conservatism	x: 3.33 to 5.56,  y: -1.11 to 1.11	Liberal Conservatism	Free-Market Right	Combines a conservative social outlook with classic liberal economics. Supports family values and tradition while backing free markets and limited government intervention. Frames itself as pragmatic center-right: enough liberty to encourage growth and innovation, enough order to maintain stability and cultural continuity in an ever-changing world.	The mainstream European center-right, including Angela Merkel and France’s Gaullist successors, mixes conservatism with liberal economics. In the U.S., figures like Senator Susan Collins fit this model: socially moderate but fiscally cautious. This balance defines much of today’s non-extreme right-wing politics in Western democracies.	Conservatism	Liberal Conservatism and Conservatism both trust tradition, but Liberal Conservatism adds markets and reform to keep those traditions viable.	Civic Conservatism	Both value responsibility and continuity, fusing personal liberty with cultural heritage to guide their politics.	Democratic Socialism	Each of them believes in balancing fairness and order, though in distinct ways.	Libertarianism	Both prize freedom, though for different reasons and scales.
ER-GM	Conservative Capitalism & National Conservatism	x: 5.56 to 7.78,  y: -1.11 to 1.11	Traditional Conservatism	Heritage Conservative	Emphasizes preserving long-standing institutions like monarchy, church, and heritage. Suspicious of both radical change and unrestrained capitalism, it seeks a stable hierarchy built on duty and virtue. Frames itself as a guardian of tradition, believing that preserving the old ways is the best path to order, meaning, and social harmony.	Edmund Burke’s 18th-century writings built the foundation of traditional conservatism. Modern “High Tory” traditionalists in the U.K. and old royalist movements in Europe keep his philosophy alive. They emphasize heritage, hierarchy, and the idea that society should evolve slowly, preserving the wisdom of past generations.	Civic Conservatism	Traditional Conservatism and Civic Conservatism both respect history, faith, and slow reform, keeping culture and order at the heart of life.	Paleoconservatism	Both hold tightly to heritage and social hierarchy, resisting disruption from rapid change or foreign influence.	Mutualism	The two value community roots, though one is top down and one is shared.	Socialism	These two oppose raw greed, though their visions differ entirely.
ER-GM	Conservative Capitalism & National Conservatism	x: 7.78 to 10.00,  y: -1.11 to 1.11	Capitalism	Free-Market Advocate	Believes the economy works best when private owners control trade and industry for profit, with minimal government interference. Champions competition, private property, and innovation as the keys to prosperity. Frames capitalism as the natural way for society to grow, assuming that personal ambition drives progress and benefits the wider public.	The United States and most Western economies operate on capitalist principles, with entrepreneurs like Elon Musk embodying the system’s values. Classic theorists like Adam Smith argued for private ownership and free markets centuries ago. Their ideas became the backbone of modern economies, shaping innovation, growth, and global commerce.	Liberal Capitalism	Capitalism and Liberal Capitalism share the same belief in markets, private property, and competition as the engine for growth and innovation.	Libertarian Capitalism	Both see wealth creation as driven by individual initiative, trusting free markets to reward effort and spur new ideas.	Georgism	Together they prize markets, though Georgism wants to reshape how land fits in.	Progressivism	Each side sees the future as shaped by action, though with different goals.
EL-GM	Democratic Socialism & Left Populism	x: -10.00 to -7.78,  y: -3.33 to -1.11	Luxemburgism	Grassroots Revolutionary	Follows Rosa Luxemburg’s vision of socialism through mass democracy, not authoritarian control. Supports revolution and worker uprisings, but insists ordinary people, not party elites, must stay in charge. Warns against dictatorship corrupting socialism, framing democracy and activism as essential to any lasting and just transformation of society.	Rosa Luxemburg fought for democratic socialism in early 20th-century Germany, opposing authoritarian communists like Lenin. Today, her ideas survive in small activist groups and socialist thinkers who advocate mass strikes and grassroots democracy. Her legacy continues to influence debates on how socialism should be achieved.	Trotskyism	Luxemburgism and Trotskyism both believe in global revolution but stress democracy and grassroots movements rather than centralized control.	Orthodox Marxism	Both uphold classic Marxist thinking, favoring education and mass action over authoritarian shortcuts to communism.	Progressivism	The pair trust people to lead change, though they see the path differently.	Civil Libertarianism	Both reject oppression, but one targets bosses and one governments.
EL-GM	Democratic Socialism & Left Populism	x: -7.78 to -5.56,  y: -3.33 to -1.11	Syndicalism	Union-Led Revolutionary	Argues that workers’ unions should overthrow capitalism and then directly run the economy. Envisions a federation of labor groups managing industries collectively, often through a general strike. Frames itself as the purest worker-led movement, bypassing politicians and bosses to put power directly into the hands of those who produce.	French and Spanish labor movements in the early 1900s pushed syndicalism, where unions would run the economy. In the U.S., the Industrial Workers of the World (“Wobblies”) promoted a similar “One Big Union” dream. These efforts showed how radical labor groups imagined bypassing government and bosses to empower workers directly.	Anarcho-Syndicalism	Syndicalism and Anarcho-Syndicalism both empower worker unions to transform society, organizing production around collective labor action.	Council Communism	Both see workers directly managing society, bypassing bosses and party elites in favor of grassroots decision-making.	Distributism	Each side trusts smaller structures, though for different reasons.	Traditional Conservatism	The pair value organic communities, though one is radical and one cautious.
EL-GM	Democratic Socialism & Left Populism	x: -5.56 to -3.33,  y: -3.33 to -1.11	Social Democracy	Welfare-Market Balancer	Wants capitalism’s inequalities softened but not abolished. Supports high taxes, strong unions, and universal programs like healthcare, pensions, and education. Frames itself as a fair version of capitalism, one where everyone has security and dignity, and where wealth is shared enough to prevent poverty without stifling enterprise or innovation.	The Nordic nations like Sweden, Denmark, and Norway show social democracy in action, blending strong welfare states with market economies. Postwar Western Europe also embraced this model, building “social market” systems that delivered prosperity, healthcare, and education while keeping capitalist competition alive.	Democratic Socialism	Social Democracy and Democratic Socialism blend markets with welfare, both seeking equality without dismantling capitalism entirely.	Market Socialism	Both use public ownership and market tools, aiming for fairness without stifling initiative or competition.	Liberal Conservatism	These two favor pragmatic reforms to maintain stability.	Georgism	Each of them thinks resources should serve everyone, in different ways.
EM-GM	Mixed-Economy Liberal Center	x: -3.33 to -1.11,  y: -3.33 to -1.11	Liberal Democracy	Rights-and-Rules Supporter	Refers to modern democracies with free elections, guaranteed rights, and checks and balances. Emphasizes freedom of speech, religion, and press, seeing them as essential. Frames itself as the gold standard of governance: protecting individuals, restraining power, and creating a framework where competing ideas can coexist without descending into chaos.	The U.S., Canada, and much of Europe are liberal democracies, combining elections, civil rights, and the rule of law. The U.S. Bill of Rights and Britain’s parliamentary tradition exemplify this. These systems protect individual freedoms while providing frameworks for orderly governance and debate between competing political visions.	Liberalism	Liberal Democracy and Liberalism both enshrine personal freedom, free elections, and rule of law as the pillars of a just society.	Centrism	Both strive for balance, combining representation and moderation to protect rights without tipping into extremes.	Distributism	The two value fairness in systems, though in different tones.	Traditional Conservatism	Together they admire order, though one is more modern in its vision.
EM-GM	Mixed-Economy Liberal Center	x: -1.11 to 1.11,  y: -3.33 to -1.11	Welfare Capitalism	Caring Capitalist	Supports capitalism but insists on a social safety net to cushion its harshness. Includes welfare programs, public healthcare, or employer benefits like pensions. Frames this as a humane version of capitalism: markets deliver growth and innovation, while safety nets ensure people are not left destitute when those markets fail or fluctuate.	Germany’s social market economy shows welfare capitalism, where the state offers safety nets but markets drive growth. In the past, large U.S. companies also offered pensions and healthcare to workers, showing how private businesses and governments alike have blended capitalism with social protections to keep workers secure.	Liberal Capitalism	Welfare Capitalism and Liberal Capitalism share markets as their base but soften their edges with social benefits for security and stability.	Social Democracy	Both merge capitalism and welfare, using safety nets to ensure people are protected while markets thrive.	Distributism	Each of them aims for fairness, though one uses policy and one small property.	Progressivism	Both see reform as a duty, though with distinct goals.
EM-GM	Mixed-Economy Liberal Center	x: 1.11 to 3.33,  y: -3.33 to -1.11	Liberal Capitalism	Light-Touch Capitalist	Supports a free-market system with almost no government interference beyond protecting property and contracts. Frames itself as “hands off,” trusting supply and demand to regulate itself. Believes individuals know best how to pursue their goals, and that government meddling only slows growth and stifles innovation.	The U.S. Gilded Age of the late 1800s was laissez-faire capitalism at its peak: industrialists like Carnegie and Rockefeller operated with almost no regulation. Modern examples like Hong Kong, with low taxes and light regulation, show how laissez-faire policies still appeal to those seeking maximum economic freedom.	Capitalism	Liberal Capitalism and Capitalism both rely on markets and private ownership, championing freedom of enterprise as the best path to prosperity.	Neoliberalism	Both back globalization and deregulation, seeing open markets as the driver of growth and efficiency.	Eco-Socialism	Together they think about resource use, though with opposite outcomes in mind.	Distributism	Each side discusses fairness, though they frame it very differently.
ER-GM	Conservative Capitalism & National Conservatism	x: 3.33 to 5.56,  y: -3.33 to -1.11	Civil Libertarianism	Freedom Advocate	Places the highest value on personal freedoms like speech, privacy, and due process, and resists any law or corporation that infringes on them. Crosses party lines, opposing surveillance, censorship, or restrictions on choice. Frames civil liberty as the foundation of all justice and argues that without it, no political or economic system is truly free.	The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) campaigns for free speech, privacy, and due process. Politicians like Rand Paul and whistleblowers like Edward Snowden also reflect civil libertarian values by opposing surveillance and restrictions. These figures and groups show how civil libertarianism actively shapes Western debates about rights and security.	Libertarianism	Civil Libertarianism and Libertarianism share fierce protection of personal freedoms, resisting intrusion from government or corporate power.	Social Libertarianism	Both insist on rights to speech, privacy, and autonomy, trusting individuals over institutions to shape their lives.	Progressivism	The pair want to expand freedoms, though one seeks reform and one limits law.	Distributism	The two value autonomy, but for very different reasons.
ER-GM	Conservative Capitalism & National Conservatism	x: 5.56 to 7.78,  y: -3.33 to -1.11	Conservative Libertarianism	Small-Government Traditionalist	Fuses conservative cultural values like family, patriotism, and gun rights with small-government economics. Champions individual liberty, free markets, and personal responsibility but through a right-leaning lens. Frames itself as defending both tradition and freedom, seeking to keep government limited while keeping cultural norms intact.	Senator Rand Paul in the U.S. blends libertarian economics with some conservative cultural views. The Tea Party movement of the 2010s also pushed for lower taxes and less government while holding traditional values. These examples illustrate how libertarianism and conservatism often overlap in Western right-leaning politics.	Libertarianism	Conservative Libertarianism and Libertarianism both demand small government and free markets, but Conservative Libertarianism adds cultural traditions.	Liberal Conservatism	Both tie liberty to cultural heritage, blending individual rights with respect for long-held values.	Distributism	These two value self reliance, though with different paths to it.	Civic Conservatism	Both cherish responsibility, though one frames it with freedom.
ER-GM	Conservative Capitalism & National Conservatism	x: 7.78 to 10.00,  y: -3.33 to -1.11	Libertarian Capitalism	Hardcore Market Libertarian	Advocates extreme laissez-faire capitalism with a state reduced to the bare minimum. Government exists only to keep peace, protect property, and enforce contracts. Frames this as pure freedom: a society where people succeed or fail entirely on their own terms, without regulations, subsidies, or interference from lawmakers or bureaucrats.	Ayn Rand’s novel “Atlas Shrugged” imagines a society of pure capitalism and minimal government. Economists like Milton Friedman promoted similar policies, though he accepted some government roles. Today, the more radical side of the Libertarian Party fully embraces her vision, making Rand an enduring icon of extreme laissez-faire ideals.	Libertarianism	Libertarian Capitalism and Libertarianism both demand minimal state interference, believing free markets and private property drive progress and personal freedom.	Capitalism	Both trust competition and ownership to fuel growth, seeing government mostly as a guardian of contracts and property rather than an economic manager.	Distributism	Each side wants people to own property, though one favors markets and one small plots.	Progressivism	These two believe change is possible, but their visions differ entirely.
EL-GL	Libertarian Socialism & Anarcho-Communism	x: -10.00 to -7.78,  y: -5.56 to -3.33	Classical Marxism	Foundational Marxist	Clings to Karl Marx’s original critique of capitalism and belief in a proletarian revolution, often interpreting it in an anti-authoritarian way. Distrusts Leninist or Maoist methods, preferring worker self-emancipation over top-down control. Frames history as a struggle that only ends when workers liberate themselves and dismantle oppressive systems.	Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels founded Marxism, inspiring early groups like the Socialist Party of Great Britain. They promoted worker education and democratic revolution over violent coups. These movements shaped how socialism developed, showing that Marx’s ideas could fuel both radical change and gradualist approaches.	Orthodox Marxism	Classical Marxism and Orthodox Marxism follow Marx’s original writings, believing class struggle will end capitalism and bring about a classless society.	Luxemburgism	Both avoid authoritarian shortcuts, stressing education, agitation, and mass worker participation to achieve revolution.	Distributism	The two worry about concentrated power, though they frame it differently.	Civic Conservatism	Each of them discusses community, but one fights for it and one protects it.
EL-GL	Libertarian Socialism & Anarcho-Communism	x: -7.78 to -5.56,  y: -5.56 to -3.33	Eco-Socialism	Green Socialist	Merges environmentalism with socialism, arguing that capitalism’s hunger for profit is destroying the planet. Calls for public or cooperative control of resources to protect ecosystems and meet needs sustainably. Frames this as the only way to stop climate collapse: combining green planning, social justice, and a break from exploitative economics.	The U.S. Green New Deal and European Green parties contain eco-socialist themes, linking environmental protection with economic reform. Groups like Extinction Rebellion argue that capitalism’s drive for profit is destroying the planet. These movements show how green activism increasingly intersects with socialist critiques of the economy.	Socialism	Eco-Socialism and Socialism share the goal of dismantling economic systems that perpetuate inequality, adding an ecological urgency to reshape society.	Progressivism	Both see reform as necessary for survival, advocating sweeping change to protect both the planet and people from harm.	Georgism	Together they think deeply about land and resources, though with different ends.	Libertarian Socialism	The pair see a freer world, though with different routes to get there.
EL-GL	Libertarian Socialism & Anarcho-Communism	x: -5.56 to -3.33,  y: -5.56 to -3.33	Progressivism	Social Reformer	Favors continual improvement of society through reform rather than upheaval. Tackles inequality, corruption, and injustice by changing laws and expanding rights. Frames progressivism as the antidote to stagnation, believing that with enough activism and gradual change, society can steadily become fairer, freer, and more humane for everyone.	The U.S. Progressive Era, including Theodore Roosevelt’s reforms, tackled corporate monopolies and corruption. Figures like Elizabeth Warren continue that tradition, fighting inequality and pushing structural reforms. This thread of progressive politics shows how steady, law-based reforms can reshape economies without calling for outright revolution.	Social Liberalism	Progressivism and Social Liberalism share faith in legal reform, believing laws and policies can dismantle injustice and bring long-term fairness.	Eco-Socialism	Both advocate systemic change to address harm, one focusing on climate and one on broader inequity, but both see reform as essential.	National Capitalism	Each of them wants to steer markets, but for opposite reasons.	Liberal Conservatism	Both prize responsibility, though they define it differently.
EM-GL	Social-Market Libertarianism	x: -3.33 to -1.11,  y: -5.56 to -3.33	Nordic Liberalism	Scandinavian Model Advocate	Draws inspiration from Scandinavian nations that mix free markets with generous welfare and liberal values. Promotes economic growth alongside universal healthcare, education, and equality. Frames itself as pragmatic and balanced, showing that prosperity and fairness can coexist when markets are tempered with compassion and public investment.	Countries like Sweden, Denmark, and Norway showcase thriving economies paired with universal benefits like healthcare and education. Policy experts see these models as proof that markets and welfare can coexist, offering both prosperity and fairness. They stand as the clearest example of balanced modern social democracy.	Social Democracy	Nordic Liberalism and Social Democracy both fuse markets with generous welfare, showing capitalism and equality can coexist in balance.	Liberalism	Both value freedom and individual rights, layering in support systems to ensure no one is left behind while pursuing opportunity.	Distributism	The pair cherish broad security, though with very different roots.	Civic Conservatism	Each side values stability, though framed in different traditions.
EM-GL	Social-Market Libertarianism	x: -1.11 to 1.11,  y: -5.56 to -3.33	Social Libertarianism	Free-Spirited Leftist	Stresses personal freedom and minimal state control, but accepts voluntary efforts to help others. Supports mutual aid and community solutions rather than government programs. Frames social libertarianism as liberty with a conscience, arguing that people can build safety nets together without needing heavy-handed state involvement or coercion.	Some “bleeding heart libertarians” blend free-market ideals with concern for the poor, supporting voluntary safety nets or even basic income. Pirate Parties and academic movements reflect this trend. These examples show that even within libertarianism, there are currents that prioritize compassion alongside personal freedom.	Libertarianism	Social Libertarianism and Libertarianism both demand individual freedom, with Social Libertarianism adding a strong concern for voluntary aid and equity.	Civil Libertarianism	Both protect civil rights and personal autonomy, rejecting coercion and trusting people to create fairer, freer communities.	Distributism	These two like community care, though for very different reasons.	Progressivism	Both expand freedoms, though they frame them differently.
EM-GL	Social-Market Libertarianism	x: 1.11 to 3.33,  y: -5.56 to -3.33	Georgism	Land Tax Advocate	Proposes taxing the value of land and natural resources to fund society, while removing taxes on labor and production. Frames land value as unearned wealth that should benefit everyone. Believes this creates fairness, discourages speculation, and frees workers and businesses to produce without the burden of excessive taxation on their efforts.	Henry George’s land tax ideas shaped reforms in the 1800s. Some cities experimented with taxing land value, and today, economists and urbanists still advocate it to fix housing costs. Calls to “tax land, not labor” surface in debates in places like London or San Francisco, keeping Georgism alive in policy talk.	Geo-Libertarianism	Georgism and Geo-Libertarianism share the idea that land and resources belong to all, calling for land taxes while freeing labor and trade from heavy burdens.	Eco-Socialism	Both see land as the root of fairness and survival, seeking to manage resources for the benefit of everyone rather than profit alone.	Traditional Conservatism	Each side attaches meaning to land, though one sees heritage and one fairness.	Capitalism	Together they trust markets partly, but in very different ways.
ER-GL	Anarcho-Capitalism & Ultra-Free-Market Libertarianism	x: 3.33 to 5.56,  y: -5.56 to -3.33	Classical Liberalism	Early Liberal Thinker	Represents the original form of liberalism, rooted in the nineteenth century. Emphasizes freedom, private property, free markets, and minimal government. Frames competition as the path to progress, arguing that when the state stays out of the way, innovation and prosperity naturally follow, with government existing only to protect basic rights.	John Locke and Adam Smith laid the foundations for classical liberalism. Politicians like William Gladstone carried these ideas into practice, promoting free markets and limited government. Today, some libertarians and moderates still identify as classical liberals, linking modern small-government views to this older intellectual tradition.	Liberalism	Classical Liberalism and Liberalism both defend free markets and personal liberty, with Classical Liberalism clinging most tightly to limited government.	Libertarianism	Both fight for economic and personal freedom, though Classical Liberalism keeps a bit more space for state duties like infrastructure.	Distributism	The two value personal ownership, though one imagines tiny farms.	Civic Conservatism	The two think community matters, but for different ends.
ER-GL	Anarcho-Capitalism & Ultra-Free-Market Libertarianism	x: 5.56 to 7.78,  y: -5.56 to -3.33	Libertarianism	Minimal-State Advocate	Argues for the smallest government possible, limited to defending people from force and fraud. Opposes regulations, taxes, and most laws, believing free markets and voluntary agreements work better. Frames itself as the truest form of freedom: a society where government barely exists and individuals take full responsibility for their lives.	The U.S. Libertarian Party embodies modern libertarianism, advocating drug legalization, low taxes, and individual choice. Politicians like Ron Paul and Gary Johnson brought these ideas into mainstream debates. Their campaigns popularized the vision of a smaller state and greater personal freedom for millions of voters.	Classical Liberalism	Libertarianism and Classical Liberalism share the call for tiny government, focusing on individual rights, property, and voluntary interactions.	Libertarian Capitalism	Both demand free markets and minimal laws, trusting private exchange and contracts to organize society better than bureaucracy.	Distributism	Together they dream of people owning their lives, but with different visions.	Progressivism	Each of them wants change, though one seeks it by shrinking power and one by using it.
ER-GL	Anarcho-Capitalism & Ultra-Free-Market Libertarianism	x: 7.78 to 10.00,  y: -5.56 to -3.33	Paleo-Libertarianism	Traditionalist Libertarian	Mixes radical free-market libertarianism with cultural conservatism and nationalism. Opposes big government but supports strong borders and traditional norms. Frames itself as defending both liberty and heritage, arguing that personal freedom is compatible with a shared moral framework and that a small state should still uphold those values.	In the 1990s, Murray Rothbard and Lew Rockwell tied libertarian economics to paleoconservative culture, creating “paleolibertarianism.” Today, the Mises Institute and similar groups continue this blend, promoting small government while stressing traditional values and nationalism. It remains a niche but persistent current in libertarian thought.	Libertarianism	Paleo-Libertarianism and Libertarianism both reject government expansion, with Paleo-Libertarianism adding cultural conservatism to the mix.	Conservative Libertarianism	Both blend liberty and tradition, arguing for a free society that still honors longstanding values and social norms.	Distributism	The pair value tradition in ownership, though for very different reasons.	Right-Wing Nationalism	Both talk about identity, though one focuses on culture and one on nation.
EL-GL	Libertarian Socialism & Anarcho-Communism	x: -10.00 to -7.78,  y: -7.78 to -5.56	Council Communism	Worker Council Advocate	Advocates for workers’ councils; 'democratic assemblies in workplaces' to overthrow capitalism and govern society. Envisions bottom-up control, with power staying in the hands of workers rather than parties or elites. Frames this as true communism: not centralized dictatorship, but a network of grassroots councils running the economy and society.	During the German Revolution of 1918–1919, council communists like Anton Pannekoek envisioned workers’ councils replacing both capitalist owners and party elites. Today, left-communist and anarchist groups keep this idea alive, seeing workplace democracy as the true path to socialism without authoritarian leaders or rigid state structures.	Anarcho-Syndicalism	Council Communism and Anarcho-Syndicalism both see worker councils as the foundation of society, bypassing parties and bosses entirely.	Syndicalism	Both call for labor groups to lead transformation, organizing production through bottom-up democratic structures.	Distributism	Each of them likes decentralization, though for different purposes.	Traditional Conservatism	These two value organic community, though they see it differently.
EL-GL	Libertarian Socialism & Anarcho-Communism	x: -7.78 to -5.56,  y: -7.78 to -5.56	Minarcho-Socialism	Minimal-State Socialist	Envisions a hybrid with an extremely small government that handles only fairness and security, while most of the economy is socialist. Frames it as socialism with a “night watchman” state: workers own industry, but the state barely exists. Highlights the tension of combining socialism’s planning with libertarian minimalism in one system.	This concept has never been implemented fully. Advocates imagine a socialist economy with only a “night-watchman” state providing minimal fairness. It lives mostly in theory and niche online debates, since even the most welfare-oriented states still rely on robust government rather than near-total decentralization.	Minarchism	Minarcho-Socialism and Minarchism share the vision of a tiny government, adding socialism’s aim of shared resources and equity within that frame.	Socialism	Both seek fairness in who owns and benefits, but Minarcho-Socialism keeps the state skeletal, a paradox that sparks interesting debate.	Distributism	These two like spreading resources, though with very different designs.	Liberalism	Each side aims for fairness, but in opposite ways.
EL-GL	Libertarian Socialism & Anarcho-Communism	x: -5.56 to -3.33,  y: -7.78 to -5.56	Libertarian Socialism	Freedom-Oriented Socialist	Asserts that true liberty requires economic equality and community control, so it opposes both state authority and capitalist ownership. Envisions a society of freely federated cooperatives and communes where people manage their own work and share resources without oppressive structures.	Anarchist collectives in Catalonia during 1936 briefly operated factories and farms cooperatively, showing libertarian socialism in action. Movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Rojava region in Syria reflect similar ideas today, experimenting with leaderless structures and direct democracy as alternatives to state or corporate power.	Anarchism	Libertarian Socialism and Anarchism share a rejection of both the state and capitalism, imagining a world of cooperative, freely chosen communities.	Socialism	Both envision equality and shared resources, but Libertarian Socialism strips out hierarchy, even from socialist structures.	Distributism	The two like community sharing, though for very different visions.	Progressivism	Both believe in change for fairness, though they approach it differently.
EM-GL	Social-Market Libertarianism	x: -3.33 to -1.11,  y: -7.78 to -5.56	Mutualism	Cooperative Trader	Envisions a society where people freely exchange goods and services through cooperatives, mutual credit systems, and without profit driven corporations or state intervention. Property is ownership by use, meaning you own something only while you actively use it, which prevents absentee landlords or monopolies.	Pierre Joseph Proudhon in nineteenth century France originated this idea. Modern echoes of mutualism appear in community barter networks, time banks, and local cooperative movements, where neighbors trade skills and goods without big corporations or heavy government control.	Anarcho-Mutualism	Mutualism and Anarcho-Mutualism share a bottom-up view of trade and property, seeing fair exchange and cooperative effort as the foundation of society.	Libertarian Socialism	Both favor voluntary cooperation over command, trusting free communities to create fairness without heavy state involvement.	Traditional Conservatism	The pair value close knit ties, though one sees them in farms and one in faith.	Distributism	The pair prize local ownership, though they frame it differently.
EM-GL	Social-Market Libertarianism	x: -1.11 to 1.11,  y: -7.78 to -5.56	Minarchism	Tiny-State Advocate	The belief in maintaining only a night watchman state, government limited to the bare essentials like defense, police, and courts, and leaving everything else such as schools, healthcare, and the economy to individuals and voluntary associations. It is essentially the step just before outright anarchism.	Many in the US Libertarian Party lean this way, arguing for drastic cuts to government. Ron Paul’s calls to eliminate departments and return to a very limited federal government exemplify minarchist philosophy, echoing earlier thinkers who said the state should do no more than guard basic security.	Minarcho-Capitalism	Minarchism and Minarcho-Capitalism both call for the smallest possible state, limited to defense, courts, and property protection while leaving markets to flourish.	Classical Liberalism	Both value individual freedom and minimal governance, envisioning a lean state that guards rights without steering the economy or social life.	Distributism	Each side sees personal ownership as important, though one sees farms and one sees markets.	Progressivism	Each of them imagines reform, but one shrinks the state while one builds it.
EM-GL	Social-Market Libertarianism	x: 1.11 to 3.33,  y: -7.78 to -5.56	Geo-Libertarianism	Land-Tax Libertarian	A libertarian philosophy that embraces taxing land value, as per Georgism, as the sole or main source of public revenue to fund a minimal state, while eliminating all other taxes on labor or capital. The idea is to reconcile needing some public finance with the principle of not taxing individual productivity.	Henry George’s land tax idea combined with libertarian minimal government finds support among some economists and libertarians. For instance, social scientist Fred Foldvary has advocated this approach. It is not practiced widely, though elements exist in places like Hong Kong’s reliance on land leases alongside low taxes.	Georgism	Geo-Libertarianism and Georgism share the idea that land’s value should be taxed for society while freeing labor and trade from heavy taxation.	Libertarianism	Both demand low government intrusion, with Geo-Libertarianism making an exception for land to ensure fairness without harming economic freedom.	Traditional Conservatism	Together they honor land, though for heritage or equity depending on the view.	Eco-Socialism	Both see land as key, though their visions for it diverge widely.
ER-GL	Anarcho-Capitalism & Ultra-Free-Market Libertarianism	x: 3.33 to 5.56,  y: -7.78 to -5.56	National Libertarianism	Patriotic Libertarian	Marries a strong nationalist streak that emphasizes sovereignty, borders, and cultural identity with libertarian calls for small government and individual freedom. It is wary of globalism or supranational institutions, wanting minimal state domestically but a firm national defense and immigration control.	Some right wing libertarian segments fit this, such as militia or patriot movements in the US that oppose federal power but are fiercely nationalistic. In Europe, Eurosceptic libertarians who champion free markets but also push for tight border control can be seen as national libertarians.	Libertarianism	National Libertarianism and Libertarianism both demand small government, but National Libertarianism ties that freedom to strong national borders and culture.	Paleo-Libertarianism	Both blend liberty with rooted identity, advocating limited government alongside deep concern for preserving traditions or sovereignty.	Distributism	The two value cultural roots, though one sees them in land and one in law.	Right-Wing Nationalism	The two emphasize nationhood, though one stresses freedom more.
ER-GL	Anarcho-Capitalism & Ultra-Free-Market Libertarianism	x: 5.56 to 7.78,  y: -7.78 to -5.56	Voluntarism	Voluntary Society Advocate	Holds that all forms of human association should be voluntary and that even participating in state institutions, such as voting or holding office, is morally suspect because the state relies on coercion. Voluntaryists thus advocate building alternatives to government and resolving issues through voluntary agreements, charity, and private contracts only.	Philosophers like Auberon Herbert in late nineteenth century Britain pioneered these ideas. In modern times, some anarcho capitalists call themselves voluntaryists, abstaining from voting and taxation. Activists in the Free State Project who try to live off grid and trade in cryptocurrency to avoid government systems are examples.	Libertarianism	Voluntarism and Libertarianism both reject coercion, believing society should run on voluntary agreements rather than force or compulsion.	Anarchism	Both imagine a world where top-down authority is replaced by freely chosen arrangements, trusting people to self-organize peacefully.	Mutualism	The pair celebrate voluntary exchange, though framed differently.	Distributism	Each side admires self reliance, but with very different solutions.
ER-GL	Anarcho-Capitalism & Ultra-Free-Market Libertarianism	x: 7.78 to 10.00,  y: -7.78 to -5.56	Minarcho-Capitalism	Minimal-State Capitalist	Essentially identical to standard minarchism: a minuscule government limited to protecting property rights and enforcing contracts, explicitly to allow a capitalist free market system to operate unimpeded. It underlines that even the minimal state exists only to uphold capitalism.	This is basically the end goal of many in the libertarian movement. Think of an ideal government that only runs courts, police, and national defense, leaving everything else to private enterprise. Ayn Rand’s envisioned government, or the Cato Institute’s policy goals, align with this minimal state capitalist model.	Minarchism	Minarcho-Capitalism and Minarchism both want a night-watchman state—only enough government to protect property, enforce contracts, and provide security.	Capitalism	Both fully embrace markets and private property, relying on the smallest possible state to keep the system running and resolve disputes.	Distributism	Each of them likes private ownership, though one sees it sprawling and one small scale.	Traditional Conservatism	Both value order, though one is market made and one cultural.
EL-GL	Libertarian Socialism & Anarcho-Communism	x: -10.00 to -7.78,  y: -10.00 to -7.78	Anarcho-Communism	Stateless Communist	Aims for a classless, moneyless society like communism but achieved through abolishing the state entirely. Small communities, or communes, would collectively own property and distribute goods based on need, cooperating freely without central authority or coercive institutions.	During the Spanish Civil War, anarchist regions such as rural collectives in Aragon and Catalonia operated on these principles for a time. Various intentional communities worldwide and the philosophy of Peter Kropotkin exemplify anarcho communism’s vision of shared wealth with total freedom.	Anarchism	Anarcho-Communism and Anarchism both seek a stateless society, with Anarcho-Communism adding communal ownership and full sharing of resources.	Libertarian Socialism	Both aim to remove state and class entirely, envisioning a world of voluntary cooperation and shared wealth without hierarchy.	Distributism	These two seek shared resources, though for entirely different reasons.	Eco-Socialism	Together they see sustainability, though from different starting points.
EL-GL	Libertarian Socialism & Anarcho-Communism	x: -7.78 to -5.56,  y: -10.00 to -7.78	Anarcho-Syndicalism	Union Anarchist	Envisions unions and worker councils as the backbone of a stateless society. Workers would seize control of factories and workplaces through direct action such as a general strike, then manage them democratically and federate with other workplaces, replacing government with a network of self managed industries.	The Spanish CNT union in 1936 and 1937 organized industries like Catalonia’s railways and factories on anarcho syndicalist lines. The Industrial Workers of the World in the US in the early 1900s advocated a similar strategy of using unions to eventually run society after capitalism’s collapse.	Syndicalism	Anarcho-Syndicalism and Syndicalism both put worker unions at the heart of social change, with the anarchist form rejecting the state entirely.	Council Communism	Both envision workers’ councils as the new foundation for society, bypassing parties and bosses for direct control of workplaces.	Distributism	The two value local structures, though one is revolutionary and one pastoral.	Traditional Conservatism	These two talk of organic community, but from opposing views.
EL-GL	Libertarian Socialism & Anarcho-Communism	x: -5.56 to -3.33,  y: -10.00 to -7.78	Anarchism	Total Freedom Advocate	Belief that all governments and hierarchies are oppressive and unnecessary, and society should be organized on a voluntary and cooperative basis without any rulers. Anarchists maintain that people can self govern in communities through mutual aid and agreements, achieving order without coercive authority.	Prominent anarchists like Emma Goldman in the early twentieth century championed these ideas. Historical episodes like the Paris Commune in 1871 or certain zones in conflict areas where local assemblies run things show anarchist principles in action. Modern anarchist influences appear in movements like Occupy or autonomous protest camps that reject formal leadership.	Libertarian Socialism	Anarchism and Libertarian Socialism both dream of a world without rulers, replacing state control with voluntary networks of cooperation.	Voluntarism	Both reject coercion in all forms, trusting humans to govern themselves through agreements rather than force or imposed authority.	Progressivism	Together they seek change, though one dismantles and one reforms.	Distributism	Both admire local responsibility, but for different reasons.
EM-GL	Social-Market Libertarianism	x: -3.33 to -1.11,  y: -10.00 to -7.78	Anarcho-Mutualism	Cooperative Anarchist	Combines Proudhon’s mutualism with full anarchism: a stateless society where people trade and form cooperatives freely, with ownership based on use and mutual agreements instead of legal titles. Essentially, it is a free market of cooperatives and independent workers with no state and no exploitative capitalist corporations.	Proudhon’s own vision was essentially anarcho mutualist. While there is no country like this, aspects appear in things like local exchange trading systems, cooperatives, or barter networks where communities self regulate trade without central authority.	Mutualism	Anarcho-Mutualism and Mutualism both promote cooperative exchange and shared responsibility, removing state oversight entirely from that vision.	Anarchism	Both reject hierarchy, with Anarcho-Mutualism tying that rejection to systems of fair exchange and ownership by use.	Distributism	Each side believes in widespread access to property, though with different aims.	Traditional Conservatism	The pair cherish close knit ties, though one sees them in farms and one in faith.
EM-GL	Social-Market Libertarianism	x: -1.11 to 1.11,  y: -10.00 to -7.78	Agorism	Counter-Economy Advocate	Pushes for creating a counter economy outside of government control as a path to liberty. Agorists encourage people to conduct business off the tax books, use alternative currencies, and form barter networks so that eventually the state becomes irrelevant and loses revenue and power.	Founded by Samuel Konkin the Third in the 1970s, agorism is practiced today by some crypto anarchists and homesteaders who trade in Bitcoin or local currencies, avoid licensing, and generally live off grid. For example, some vendors at unregulated markets or crypto marketplaces consider their work agorist activism.	Libertarianism	Agorism and Libertarianism both seek to shrink the state, but Agorism pushes further, urging people to bypass it entirely through underground markets.	Voluntarism	Both believe in voluntary exchange, with Agorism focusing on creating entire parallel economies to starve the state of power and revenue.	Distributism	The pair imagine smaller networks of trade, but for different visions.	Progressivism	Each of them thinks about change, though one avoids government and one uses it.
EM-GL	Social-Market Libertarianism	x: 1.11 to 3.33,  y: -10.00 to -7.78	Geoanarchism	Land-Tax Anarchist	Imagines a stateless society that still adheres to the Georgist principle: land and natural resources would be held in common or require a rent paid to the community, not to a government but to local associations or cooperatives, as a condition of use. It is like a voluntary anarchist version of a land value tax system.	No real world instance of this exists, as it is largely theoretical. You could imagine something like a commune where anyone who farms a piece of land gives an agreed share of their harvest into a communal pot as “land dues.” It is discussed among niche Georgist and libertarian thinkers, but remains an idea rather than practice.	Georgism	Geoanarchism and Georgism both see land as belonging to all, but Geoanarchism imagines this fairness happening with no state at all.	Anarchism	Both reject centralized power, with Geoanarchism tying land-sharing ideals into a fully stateless vision for society.	Distributism	These two dream of fair land access, though their paths differ.	Eco-Socialism	Both see land and fairness as linked, though in different ways.
ER-GL	Anarcho-Capitalism & Ultra-Free-Market Libertarianism	x: 3.33 to 5.56,  y: -10.00 to -7.78	Objectivism	Self-Interest Philosopher	Ayn Rand’s philosophy advocating rational self interest as the highest moral calling and laissez faire capitalism as the ideal economic system. It calls for a minimal government only to protect rights. Altruism and collectivism are rejected in favor of individual achievement and personal happiness as moral virtues.	Ayn Rand’s novels “Atlas Shrugged” and “The Fountainhead” illustrate Objectivism. Followers established the Ayn Rand Institute to spread these ideas. Alan Greenspan, before leading the US Federal Reserve, was part of Rand’s inner circle. Some tech entrepreneurs and political figures, like former House Speaker Paul Ryan, have cited inspiration from Rand’s Objectivist ideas.	Libertarian Capitalism	Objectivism and Libertarian Capitalism both celebrate individual achievement and free markets, seeing self-interest as the highest driver of progress.	Classical Liberalism	Both defend personal rights and limited state power, though Objectivism frames it through a moral code of rational self-interest.	Progressivism	The two talk about human potential, though in entirely different tones.	National Libertarianism	The two see strength in identity, though one is personal and one national.
ER-GL	Anarcho-Capitalism & Ultra-Free-Market Libertarianism	x: 5.56 to 7.78,  y: -10.00 to -7.78	Anarcho-Feudalism	Neo-Feudalist Dreamer	A theoretical scenario, often tongue in cheek, where in the absence of a state, society falls into a patchwork of feudal like fiefdoms. Local lords or warlords provide protection in exchange for loyalty or fees, all supposedly voluntary since no central government exists. It is essentially medieval feudal hierarchy but without a unifying state, considered more a speculative or satirical idea than a serious model.	There is no real example of voluntary feudalism. Occasionally, parts of failed states with warlords might resemble it, such as war torn regions where local strongmen rule, but those are not exactly voluntary or ideologically driven. “Anarcho feudalism” mostly appears in internet discussions or fiction as a hypothetical extreme.	Anarchism	Anarcho-Feudalism and Anarchism share the rejection of a central state, but Anarcho-Feudalism imagines voluntary micro-kingdoms taking its place.	Voluntarism	Both oppose forced authority, though Anarcho-Feudalism’s voluntary fiefdoms show how freedom could paradoxically create tiny hierarchies.	Traditional Conservatism	Each of them values rooted loyalty, though one is chaotic and one structured.	Distributism	Each side imagines land tied to people, though for very different reasons.
ER-GL	Anarcho-Capitalism & Ultra-Free-Market Libertarianism	x: 7.78 to 10.00,  y: -10.00 to -7.78	Anarcho-Capitalism	Stateless Capitalist	Proposes the complete elimination of the state in favor of private voluntary arrangements for all services, even law, security, and infrastructure would be provided by competing businesses or cooperatives. Society would run entirely on contracts and the free market, with property rights enforced by private means.	No country has ever been anarcho capitalist, but its ideas come from economists like Murray Rothbard. Some libertarian activists experiment with it, such as seasteading projects to build floating cities outside any country’s jurisdiction. In everyday life, aspects appear in things like private arbitration or gated communities with their own security. Scaled up, that is the anarcho capitalist vision.	Libertarian Capitalism	Anarcho-Capitalism and Libertarian Capitalism both push markets and private property, but Anarcho-Capitalism removes even the minimal state entirely.	Anarchism	Both reject the state altogether, though Anarcho-Capitalism replaces it with private law and order instead of collective governance.	Objectivism	Together they glorify self interest and property, though framed differently.	Distributism	Both dream of ownership, but one imagines corporations and one farms.
